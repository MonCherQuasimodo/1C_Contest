Once a godfather from a distant province came to the wedding of electricians. As soon as the steps creaked at the threshold, I met the bride, well, what a sin to conceal, a spark slipped between them. The godfather sits all evening, admires the beauty, and she makes eyes at him. The tension in the air is serious, the groom tears his shirt on himself, but does not want to denigrate his beloved in front of the guests. The groom waited until everyone scattered about the rooms and fell asleep in a sound sleep, and called the godfather to explain. Guests wake up in the morning, the whole porch is covered in blood, the steps do not creak - they are broken, but there is no one in the neighborhood. They began to call friends, hospitals, morgues. It turned out that the groom was dying in the district hospital. And there is no news about the godfather. Well, they decided to call the police, but that's bad luck, the phone was discharged, and a mile away, as if on evil, not a single communication device.
Then I met with one of the guests, got into a conversation with him, I ask him word for word:
-A godfather what?
-And the godfather sat down.
